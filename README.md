__A WORK IN PROGRESS__

## Code for Neuroimage 2021, _in preperation_
__TO-DOS:__
- Clean up to leave only the essential
  - Stuck at processFeatSel.m because credibleInt2D.m is missing. Cannot even find it in git history; must have been saved outside of the git folders by mistake :-(
- Move the main branch into a dev branch
- Move this branch into a release branch
